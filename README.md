### What I learned

I've been practicing foundational HTML and CSS skills on Frontend Mentor by building a simple centered card component. My focus has been on responsive design, ensuring that the card and its contents (image and text) adjust for different screen sizes. Through this, I've developed a better understanding of layout techniques, such as using flexbox for centering, and make my app responsive using rem units to make sure the design remains visually balanced across devices.
